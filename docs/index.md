This is a collection of guides to install and run hugo server, a static site generator.

I have written these guides out of necessity. I would attempt to complete a task but found the online documentation wanting.

[How to Configure Prism Syntaxing](/hugo-guide/guides/prism-syntaxing-cupper-theme-hugo.html) - What I have discovered is, that out of the box, the Cupper theme does not have Prism Syntaxing completely configured. Fortunately, Prism has a very easy way of setting up the configuration for your theme.

[Install Google Fonts](/hugo-guide/guides/installing-google-fonts-hugo-theme.html) - Within the Google Chrome browser, you can use Google fonts for your Hugo site.
